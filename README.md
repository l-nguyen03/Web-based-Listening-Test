# Web-based-Listening-Test

  This repo contains the JavaScript, HTML and CSS that used to create a web application for a web-based listening test. This test was part of my bachelor thesis, which examines different psycho-acoustical effects of simulated Active Noise Cancellation Headphones characteristics. The web-app asks user to listen to different audio examples (which belongs to the company where I wrote my thesis and therefore not published here) and rate them on different scale.
